If I start a software company, I would like to choose Krishna Kowshik, my best friend since 2016. 
Though he didn't make it into Computer Science Engineering in B. tech, his strong passion for technology 
made him explore new things like DevOps and Web Development. His loyalty, eagerness to learn about nature,
and passion for technology made me select him as my partner.
 
The second person I would like to choose is Sindhu, my project partner for one year. She's a quick learner and tech expert. She's Creative and has the strong ability
to build relationships which helps me in the growth of our software company.
